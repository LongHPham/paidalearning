- **Performance Learning**: Adapts to player behavior
- **Model Retraining**: Continuously improves

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
lsof -i :3000

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### ML Model Issues
- The system falls back to rule-based generation if ML fails
- Check console for "Falling back to rule-based question generation"

### Connection Issues
- Refresh browser windows
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure server is running
